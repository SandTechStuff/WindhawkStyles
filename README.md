# WindhawkStyles

A collection of my miscellaneous Windhawk styler mod styles that are either too small or too niche to be themes.

## 10FlyoutFix

_Notification Center Styler_

Removes the white focus outlines and restores the Windows 10 fonts when using the Windows 10 tray flyouts on Windows 11.

## 11TaskbarOnTopFix

_Taskbar Styler_

Puts the running indicator on top of the icons. Makes the bounce animation come from the correct directions.

## 2004Start

_Start Menu Styler_

Restores colored tiles and text margins on the Windows 10 Start Menu, last seen in version 2004. Only applies accent color as getting icons' dominant color is not possible with the styler mods. Mainly for Windows 11 with the 10 Start menu, as Windows 10 has a better alternative.
